- **Features:** Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.

### 3. Property Management

- **Endpoints:** `/properties/`, `/properties/{property_id}/`
- **Features:** Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

### 4. Booking System

- **Endpoints:** `/bookings/`, `/bookings/{booking_id}/`
- **Features:** Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.

### 5. Payment Processing

- **Endpoints:** `/payments/`
- **Features:** Handle payment transactions related to bookings.

### 6. Review System

- **Features:** Post and manage reviews for properties.

### 7. Database Optimizations

- **Indexing:** Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
- **Caching:** Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## API Security

### Key Security Measures

- **Authentication:**
  - Implement secure login systems using tokens (e.g., JWT).
  - Ensures that only verified users can access protected endpoints.
- **Authorization:**

  - Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict actions based on user roles (e.g., admin, regular user).
  - Prevents unauthorized users from performing sensitive operations.

- **Rate Limiting:**

  - Set limits on the number of API requests a user or IP address can make within a given time.
  - Protects the API from abuse, brute-force attacks, and overloading.

- **Data Encryption:**

  - Use HTTPS to encrypt all data transmitted between the client and server.
  - Safeguards sensitive information such as login credentials and payment details.

- **Input Validation:**
  - Validate all incoming data to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
  - Maintains data integrity and security across the system.

### Importance of Security in Key Project Areas

- **User Data Protection:**

  - Securing authentication and authorization mechanisms protects personal information like emails, passwords, and profiles from breaches.

- **Payment Security:**

  - Ensuring encryption and secure APIs prevents financial data from being intercepted or tampered with during transactions.

- **Booking and Property Management:**

  - Protecting booking operations and property listings ensures that only authorized users can modify or access sensitive property information.

- **System Stability:**
  - Implementing rate limiting and input validation helps maintain the stability and integrity of the backend against malicious attacks.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically tests and integrates code changes into the main branch to catch errors early and maintain code quality.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Automatically deploys validated changes to production or staging environments, ensuring faster and more reliable releases.

### Importance for This Project

- **Faster Development Cycles:** Automated testing and deployment speed up the feedback and release process.
- **Higher Code Quality:** Continuous testing helps catch bugs early, reducing issues in production.
- **Reliability:** Automated deployments reduce the risks associated with manual errors during release.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that code moves through development, testing, and deployment stages in a consistent and repeatable way.

### Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows.
- **Docker:** Creates consistent containerized environments for development, testing, and production.
- **Docker Compose:** Manages multi-container applications (e.g., backend API, database) during development and testing.
- **PostgreSQL:** Used within the CI pipeline for database integration testing.
- **Coverage Tools (e.g., Coverage.py):** Measures code coverage during automated tests.
