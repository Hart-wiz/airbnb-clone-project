# airbnb-clone-project

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## Objective

The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

## Project Goals

- **User Management:** Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Property Management:** Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
- **Booking System:** Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
- **Payment Processing:** Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
- **Review System:** Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- **Data Optimization:** Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Team Roles

- **Backend Developer:** Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- **Database Administrator:** Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- **DevOps Engineer:** Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
- **QA Engineer:** Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## Technology Stack

- **Django:** A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django REST Framework:** Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL:** Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- **Celery:** Handles asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- **Redis:** Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker:** Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
